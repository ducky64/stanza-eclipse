# stanza-eclipse
*You'll have to pry my IDE from my cold, dead hands.*

An Eclipse plugin for the Stanza programming language. Still very, very basic
(only syntax highlighting support).

## Installation Instructions
*Because it's not quite ready for an update site yet...*

1. Compile the plugin by loading it in Eclipse and going to File > Export,
selecting Plug-in Development > Deployable plug-ins and fragments.
2. Drop the compiled .jar file in your eclipse/dropins/stanza/plugins folder.
